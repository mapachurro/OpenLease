# 0.5.0 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0))

##### New features
* Added `Simulation` for composition and abstraction of `ReactTestUtils.Simulate` procedures.
* Added `Sel` for easy DOM lookup in tests. Eg. `Sel(".inner a.active.new") findIn myComponent`.
* Experimental Scala-based component mixins. Three mixins are included.  [See examples](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/blob/master/example/src/main/scala/japgolly/scalajs/react/example/ExperimentExamples.scala).
  * `OnUnmount` - Automatically run stuff when the component unmounts.
  * `SetInterval` - Same as JS `window.setInterval` but automatically calls `clearInterval` on unmount.
  * `Listenable` - A component is able to receive external data. Automatically registers to receive data on mount, and unregisters to stop on unmount.
* Added `ScalazReact.ReactS.liftR` of type `(S ⇒ ReactST[M,S,A]) ⇒ ReactST[M,S,A]`.
* New method `ReactComponentB.domType` now allows you to specify the type returned by `.getDOMNode()` on your component.

##### Fixes & improvements
* Bugfix for tag attributes with primitive values.
  Eg. `input(tpe := "checkbox", checked := false)` works now.
* `ScalazReact`'s `~~>` and `runState` functions are now lazy.
* Upgrade [Scalatags](https://github.com/lihaoyi/scalatags) to 0.4.2. Fixes sourcemap warnings.

##### API changes
Most people will be unaffected by this. Numerous changes were made to internal types making them more consistent _(see [TYPES.md](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/blob/master/TYPES.md))_.
* `ReactComponentB` accepts an optional DOM node type, which is propagated to `ReactComponentU` and `ReactComponentM`.
* Just as umounted Scala and JS components are denoted by `ReactComponentU` and `ReactComponentU_` respectively,
  mounted Scala and JS components are now denoted by `ReactComponentM` and `ReactComponentM_`.
* Type changes.
  * `ReactComponentB` innards reworked. Use `ReactComponentB[P,S,B]` in place of `ReactComponentB[P]#B2[S]#B3[B]#B4[C]`.
  * `CompCtor`   → `ReactComponentC`
  * `CompCtorP`  → `ReactComponentC.ReqProps`
  * `CompCtorOP` → `ReactComponentC.DefaultProps`
  * `CompCtorNP` → `ReactComponentC.ConstProps`
  * `ReactComponentM` → `ReactComponentM_`
  * `ComponentConstructor_` → `ReactComponentC_`
  * `ComponentConstructor` → `ReactComponentCU`

##### Deprecated
* The following have been renamed, the old names deprecated:
  * `ReactComponentB.create` → `build`
  * `ReactComponentB.createU` → `buildU`
  * `ReactComponentB.propsAlways` → `propsConst`
  * `Nop` → `EmptyTag`
