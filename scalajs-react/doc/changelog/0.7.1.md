# 0.7.1 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1))

* Support custom tags, attributes and styles via `"string".react{Attr,Style,Tag}`.
* The `class` attribute now gets some special treatment in that it appends rather than overwrites.
  `<.div(^.cls := "a", ^.cls := "b")` is now the same as `<.div(^.cls := "a b")`.
