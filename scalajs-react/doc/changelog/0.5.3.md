## 0.5.3 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/compare/v0.5.2...v0.5.3))

* Deprecated and renamed `StateT.liftR` in favour of `liftS`.
* Workaround for Scala's type inference failing with `StateT.liftS` on functions.
  Instead of `f(_).liftS`, `f.liftS` is now available and is confirmed to work in `_runState`.
