## 1.3.0

* The `.getDOMNode` callback can sometimes execute when unmounted which is an increasingly annoying bug to track down.
  Since React 16 with its new burn-it-all-down error handling approach, an occurance of this can be fatal
  _(and caused my entire app to just suddenly unmount in disappear in the middle of a demo)_.<br>
  This release adjusts the types to restore compile-time safety. Unfortunately it's a breaking change.
  There is now a proper ADT:

  ```
                                 ComponentDom
                                  ↑        ↑
               ComponentDom.Mounted        ComponentDom.Unmounted
                  ↑            ↑
  ComponentDom.Element      ComponentDom.Text
  ```

  Calling `.getDOMNode` from without lifecycle callbacks, returns a `ComponentDom.Mounted`, logically equivalent to before.
  Calling `.getDOMNode` on a mounted component instance or a `BackendScope` now returns `ComponentDom`
  which may or may not be mounted.
  Jump into the `ComponentDom` source to see the available methods but in most cases you'll use one of the following:

  ```scala
  trait ComponentDom {
    def mounted  : Option[ComponentDom.Mounted]
    def toElement: Option[dom.Element]
    def toText   : Option[dom.Text]
  ```

  In unit tests you'll typically use `asMounted().asElement()` or `asMounted().asText()` for inspection.

* React 16.3 support
  * New component lifecycle: `getDerivedStateFromProps`
  * New component lifecycle: `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`
    <br>There is compile-time enforcement of some rules around `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`
    which you'll find out about at compile-time _(in an informative way)_ if you violate;
    you can also read about it and how it was implemented here:
    https://japgolly.blogspot.com/2018/07/enforcing-rules-at-compile-time-example.html
  * React Context API implemented via `React.createContext` and `React.Context`.
  * React ref forwarding
    * Forward a ref via `React.forwardRef`
    * Wrap a JS ref-forwarding component via `JsForwardRefComponent`
    * Refs are now based on `React.createRef()`
    * Components now have `.withRef` functions just like VDOM
    * [docs & example](../REFS.md#forwarding-refs)
  * Add `React.StrictMode`

* React 16.4 support
  * Add new types:
    * `ReactPointerEvent`
    * `ReactPointerEventFrom[N]`
    * `ReactPointerEventFromHtml`
    * `ReactPointerEventFromInput`
    * `ReactPointerEventFromTextArea`
  * Add new events to the vdom and for tests, event simulation:
    * `onGotPointerCapture`
    * `onLostPointerCapture`
    * `onPointerCancel`
    * `onPointerDown`
    * `onPointerEnter`
    * `onPointerLeave`
    * `onPointerMove`
    * `onPointerOut`
    * `onPointerOver`
    * `onPointerUp`

* React 16.5 support
  * New event: `onAuxClick`
  * New mouse event attributes: `movementX` and `movementY`
  * New pointer event attributes: `tangentialPressure` and `twist`

* Adding support for React 16.3's new `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` lifecycle callback was quite disruptive
  and resulted in the following knock-on changes:
  * `.configure` in `ScalaComponent.builder` now only accepts one argument.
  * `ScalaComponent.Config` (used for externalising and reusing opaque component lifecycle logic) has changed from
     a bearable `type Config[P, C <: Children, S, B]` to the horrendous definition below. It's not something that
     many people use and even when they do it's infrequent, but hopefully a workaround can be found soon anyway.

     ```scala
     /** This is terrible and repulsive but Scala doesn't allow anything less repulsive.
       * We'll keep this correctly modelling the reality for now and soon see if maybe we can use macros to
       * simplify it's creation (and avoid the need to use this explicitly).
       */
     type Config[P, C <: Children, S, B, US <: UpdateSnapshot, US2 <: UpdateSnapshot]
     ```
  * `LogLifecycle` has been deleted without replacement

* Added to `ScalaComponent.builder`: `.configureWhen` and `.configureUnless`

* Deprecated `ReactFragment` and replaced with `React.Fragment`

* Add `setRequestHeader` to Ajax

* Trying to treat a JS Symbol as a React component now provides a meaningful error message

* Add `cloneElement(…)` to React JS facade

* Add to `japgolly.scalajs.react.test.SimEvent.{Mouse,Pointer}`
  * `def simulateClick` and `def simulationClick`
  * `def simulateContextMenu` and `def simulationContextMenu`
  * `def simulateDoubleClick` and `def simulationDoubleClick`

* New HTML attributes
  * `noModule`
  * `playsInline`

* New SVG attribute: `focusable`

* `ScalaFnComponent`s that have a Props type of `Unit` are now invoked as `Blah()` instead of `Blah(())`

* Deprecate`asEventDefault` in the `object CallbackOption` and move it to the `class CallbackOption`

* Add `asEventDefault` to `Callback(To)`

* Update dependencies:
  * Cats to 1.4.0
  * Scalaz to 7.2.26
  * Scala.JS to 0.6.25
