\centered **Ohio Residential Lease Agreement**

^**THIS AGREEMENT** (hereinafter referred to as the "***Ohio Lease Agreement***") is made and entered as of [[Effective Date: Date]], by and between [[Landlord Name]] (hereinafter referred to as "***Landlord***") and [[Tenant Name]] (hereinafter referred to as "***Tenant***").

^For and in consideration of the covenants and obligations contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

^^**PROPERTY.** Landlord owns certain real property and improvements located at [[Property Location: Address]] (hereinafter referred to as the "***Property***"). Landlord desires to lease the Premises to Tenant upon the terms and conditions contained herein. Tenant desires to lease the Premises from Landlord on the terms and conditions as contained herein.

^^**TERM.** This Ohio Lease Agreement shall commence on [[Lease Commencement Date: Date]] and shall continue as a lease for term. The termination date shall be on [[Lease Termination Date]] at 11:59 PM. Upon termination date, Tenant shall be required to vacate the Premises unless one of the following circumstances occur:
^^^Landlord and Tenant formally extend this Ohio Lease Agreement in writing or create and execute a new, written, and signed Ohio Lease Agreement; or
^^^Landlord willingly accepts new Rent from Tenant, which does not constitute past due Rent.

^^In the event that Landlord accepts new rent from Tenant after the termination date, a month-to month tenancy shall be created. If at any time either party desires to terminate the month-to month tenancy, such party may do so by providing to the other party written notice of intention to terminate at least 30 days prior to the desired date of termination of the month-to-month tenancy. Notices to terminate may be given on any calendar day, irrespective of Commencement Date. Rent shall continue at the rate specified in this Ohio Lease Agreement, or as allowed by law. All other terms and conditions as outlined in this Ohio Lease Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Time is of the essence for providing notice of termination (strict compliance with dates by which notice must be provided is required).

^^**RENT.** Tenant shall pay to Landlord the sum of $[[Rent Amount: Number]] per month as Rent for the Term of the Agreement. Due date for Rent payment shall be the [[Rent Due Date "Which day of the month is rent due? e.g., 'third'"]] day of each calendar month and shall be considered advance payment for that month (the "***Rent Due Date***"). Weekends and holidays do not delay or excuse Tenant’s obligation to timely pay rent.

^^**Delinquent Rent.** If not paid on the Rent Due Date, Rent shall be considered overdue and delinquent.

^^**Returned Checks.** In the event that any payment by Tenant is returned for insufficient funds ("***NSF***") or if Tenant stops payment, Tenant will pay $[[Returned Check Fee: Number]] to Landlord for each such check, plus late charges, as described above, until Landlord has received payment. Furthermore, Landlord may require in writing that Tenant pay all future Rent payments by cash, money order, or cashier's check.

^^**Order in which funds are applied.** Landlord will apply all funds received from Tenant first to any non-rent obligations of Tenant including late charges, returned check charges, charge-backs for repairs, brokerage fees, and periodic utilities, then to rent, regardless of any notations on a check.

^^**Rent Increases.** There will be no rent increases through the Termination Date. If this lease is renewed automatically on a month to month basis, Landlord may increase the rent during the renewal period by providing written notice to Tenant that becomes effective the month following the [[Rent Increase Date "What day after notice is received will rent increase? e.g., 'third'"]] day after the notice is provided.

^^**SECURITY DEPOSIT.** Upon execution of this Ohio Lease Agreement, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord the sum of $[[Security Deposit Amount: Number]] (which amount is not in excess of two months periodic rent) receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by Landlord, as security for any damage caused to the Premises during the term hereof. Landlord may place the security deposit in an interest bearing account and any interest earned will be paid to Landlord or Landlord’s representative.

^^**REFUND.** Upon termination of the tenancy, all funds held by the landlord as security deposit may be applied to the payment of accrued rent and the amount of damages that the landlord has suffered by reason of the tenant's noncompliance with the terms of this Ohio Lease Agreement or with any and all laws, ordinances, rules and orders of any and all governmental or quasi-governmental authorities affecting the cleanliness, use, occupancy and preservation of the Premises.

^^^Costs of reletting, if Tenant is in default; 
^^^Attorney fees and costs of court incurred in any proceeding against Tenant;
^^^Any fee due for early of removal of an authorized keybox;
^^^Other items Tenant is responsible to pay under this Lease.
^^^If deductions exceed the security deposit, Tenant will pay to Landlord the excess within ten days after Landlord makes written demand. The security deposit will be applied first to any non-rent items, including late charges, returned check charges, repairs, brokerage fees, and periodic utilities, then to any unpaid rent.
