JDT Core
========

This is the core part of Eclipse's Java development tools. It contains the non-UI support for compiling and working with Java code, including the following:

* an incremental or batch Java compiler that can run standalone or as part of the Eclipse IDE
* Java source and class file indexer and search infrastructure
* a Java source code formatter
* APIs for code assist, access to the AST and structured manipulation of Java source.

For more information, refer to the [JDT wiki page] [1] or the [JDT project overview page] [2].
